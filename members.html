I’m currently a Junior studying Chemical Engineering and I rushed my first semester at UofM in Fall 2021. This org has given me so many amazing professional opportunities and lifelong friendships. I love the amazing people in this org so incredibly much and can’t imagine my undergrad life without them. So excited to be prez and for our Winter 2024 PC (but prob most excited for summer camping trip)"

                    <p>Community outreach is a very exciting chair position because it allows for Alpha Chi Sigma to give back to the Ann Arbor community and beyond to try to make the world a little better in the different ways we can. To reflect the chemistry that our professional fraternity stands for, we try to do science related events such as supporting children in their scientific curiosity through events like FEMMES and science Olympiad. We also do other events that we feel we can make a difference with, such as Ukrainian English tutoring, helping ill cats, habitat for humanity, and more. Community outreach is always expanding and changing to try to best fit community needs. </p>

And our scope is not limited to the University of Michigan, last year we hosted Dr. Levin from the University of Chicago as part of our Bartell Lecture Series. </p>

                    <p> As Chemists, we have a unique responsibility to the Earth. The compounds we synthesize, drugs we develop, and chemicals we produce and use have a direct relationship with our environment. However, our Chapter recognizes the importance of doing more for the earth and thus coordinates additional efforts to live sustainably and preserve the planet for future generations of chemists. Our chapter's sustainability efforts are centered on promoting local businesses, recycling, waste reduction, and garden preparation. We visit the Bring Your Own Container store to stock up on household supplies in our own reused container, shop at the Ann Arbor Farmers Market, and collect cans and bottles for recycling. We started garden preparations early by sprouting seeds indoors in repurposed egg cartons, in anticipation of our summer garden. The garden is an excellent way to promote healthy eating habits, save money, and encourage our members to take care of the environment. </p>
