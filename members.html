                    <p>The Community Outreach chair position is particularly exciting because it provides Alpha Chi Sigma with the opportunity to contribute to the Ann Arbor community and beyond, aiming to make a positive impact in various ways. Aligned with the principles of our professional fraternity, we focus on science-related events like supporting children's scientific curiosity through programs such as FEMMES and Science Olympiad. Additionally, we engage in various activities, including Ukrainian English tutoring, volunteering to help cats with leukemia, participating in Habitat for Humanity, and more. Community outreach is always expanding and changing to try to best fit community needs. </p>

Our professional support system includes study tables, speaker series, and research presentations conducted by our own members, creating a valuable network that aids them in their coursework and provides insights into diverse research happening on campus, both among our brothers and with professors. Our influence also extends beyond the University of Michigan; last year, we were honored to host Dr. Levin from the University of Chicago as part of our Bartell Lecture Series. </p>

                    <p> Our sustainability initiatives revolve around supporting local businesses, minimizing waste, and gardening. Our members adopt eco-friendly habits such as shopping at the Bring Your Own Container store, where we stock up on household supplies in our reusable containers, and exploring the Ann Arbor Farmers Market. Additionally, we contribute to recycling efforts by collecting cans and bottles. We upkeep a yearly garden, focusing on early garden preparations by sprouting seeds indoors in repurposed egg cartons, laying the groundwork for a vibrant summer garden. This garden not only promotes healthy eating habits and cost savings but also instills a sense of environmental stewardship among our members. </p>
